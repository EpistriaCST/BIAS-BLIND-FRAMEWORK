# BB-BPRF Implementation Examples Readme

## Running the Demo
```bash
pip install numpy
python basic_implementation.py
```

## What This Demonstrates

- Population-of-one baselines with no demographic data
- Variance reduction vs naive group baselines  
- Cryptographic EIV rotation every epoch
- Adversarial update rejection (z-score > 4)
- Convergence tracking via KL divergence

## Key Insight

Notice there's no demographic data anywhere. The system literally cannot discriminate by race, gender, age, etc. because those variables don't exist in the mathematical space.
