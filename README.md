Population-of-one calibration for bias-free behavioral analysis.

## What This Solves

AI systems discriminate because they collect demographic data.  
BB-BPRF makes discrimination **architecturally impossible** by never collecting, inferring, or computing demographic information in the first place.

**The Problem:** Most bias mitigation adds filters after harm occurs — like patching a broken pipe.  
**The Solution:** Don’t create the data that enables discrimination.  
No demographics → no discrimination → no compliance exposure.

## How It Works

BB-BPRF calibrates recognition to each individual's personal baseline rather than comparing them to demographic groups:

- **Population-of-one:** Each person is only compared to themselves  
- **No demographic data:** The system literally cannot “see” race, gender, or age  
- **6–12× information advantage:** Individual baselines contain ~40 bits of behavioral data vs. ~3–5 bits from group categories  
- **Mathematically proven:** Convergence typically achieved within 6–8 sessions

## Technical Innovation

1. **Ephemeral Initialization Vectors (EIVs):** Temporary calibration states that self-destruct once the personal baseline stabilizes.  
2. **Structural impossibility:** Between-group variance is undefined, not zero — it simply cannot be computed.  
3. **Sub-millisecond inference:** Real-time adaptation (< 0.1 ms latency) on commodity hardware.

## Who Should Use This

- Organizations facing discrimination-related risk or audits  
- AI and compliance teams needing demonstrable fairness proofs  
- Healthcare, hiring, education, or finance applications  
- Any ML system making protected-class decisions

## Why It Matters

BB-BPRF turns fairness from a policy choice into an engineering constraint.  
By eliminating demographic visibility, it achieves **bias-blind recognition by construction** — measurable, reproducible, and regulator-defensible.  

> **EMA remembers. KL verifies. EIV forgets.**  
> Together they create bias-blind intelligence — adaptive, private, and immune to demographic drift.
